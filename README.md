# Github repository description
Includes a Jupyter Notebook that compares the performance of the classifiers encountered thus far in the AI/ML bootcamp: namely K Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, 
Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines. To compare the classifier performances, a dataset related to marketing bank products over the telephone was utilized. The
dataset (bank-additional-full.csv) is also included here.

# Summary of findings:
From the presented results, the decision tree classifier is consistently the most accurate classifier for both the training and test sets whether default parameters were 
used with minimal dataset features or if the model hyperparameters were tuned and all dataset features were used. The classifier that exhibited the lowest accuracy score 
was the support vector machine method.

# Conclusions and recommendations:
In conclusion, the model that can identify main customer characteristics that lead to a client subscribing to a long-term deposit is a decision 
tree classifier as it has the best training and testing accuracies as compared to the other classifiers. In other words, you can confidently predict whether a client 
would want to subscribe to a long-term deposit without having to call them or use up other resources.
For clients who are predicted to subscribe to long-term deposits, I recommend you to directly send them emails with an attached link that leads them to a webpage that 
allows for easy subscription to long-term deposits.
